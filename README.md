## About The Project

I needed to get reacquainted with Python and learn a little bit of OpenCV for work. Also needed to get a security system for the house. Two birds, one stone.

## Built With

Raspberry Pi Zero W
NoIR Camera V2
Redis - For realtime image sharing.
Python
OpenCV - For Image processing
PyGame - For audio alerting

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need at the very least 1 Pi to act as the HostImager, and 1 other machine to act as the DisplayServer. Make sure to `sudo apt-get update` and that you have a working `pip`/`pip3` and `python`/`python3` on all machines.


### Installation

#### Setting up the Pi (alerter and/or imager):

Starting from a fresh install of a Raspberry Pi run the following to get the openCV libraries prepped before pip. 

```
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev libhdf5-100
sudo apt-get install libqtgui4 libqtwebkit4 libqt4-test
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev
sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev
```

then finally you'll need to pip all your python dependencies in

```
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
pip3 install redis
```

#### Setting up the DisplayServer 

I guess this could be any machine, I used my desktop but might port to a different pi at some point in the future

Install and run the redis server 
- https://redis.io/topics/quickstart
- After it's up and running you'll need to allow connections from your Pi to your DisplayServer `./src/redis-cli` then at the CLI prompt `CONFIG SET protected-mode no`. You're looking for a response `"OKAY"`

Pip all your same dependencies, but you'll also need ffmpeg
`pip install ffmpeg-python`
and the binary `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
